Features of the Refactored C++ Source Code
The following is a comprehensive list of all features in the refactored C++23 source code, combining the advanced functionalities from both provided files into a single, cohesive, and scalable solution.

Core and Advanced Features (from previous versions)
Unified Hierarchical Design: The code is structured with a low-level UltraAllocator for memory management and a high-level ObjectPool for object lifecycle management.

Dynamic Logging and Auditing: A Logger class with configurable levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) and a placeholder for sending critical events to an auditing service.

Policy-Based Design: The use of policies allows for customizable behavior for logging (VerbosePolicy, SilentPolicy) and locking strategies.

Configurable Locking Strategies: Defines concepts and policy structs for various locking mechanisms (std::mutex, std::shared_mutex).

Hybrid Memory Allocation: UltraAllocator uses both a fast slab allocator for small objects and a best-fit allocator for larger, variable-sized blocks.

Memory Defragmentation: The compactAndDefragment() method reclaims fragmented memory.

Persistent Memory: The allocator can map a file to memory, allowing the pool to persist across sessions.

Memory Protection: Methods like protectReadOnly() and protectReadWrite() change memory permissions at runtime.

Memory Integrity Checks: The validateIntegrity() function simulates a check for data corruption.

Leak Detection: The UltraAllocator's destructor automatically reports memory that was not properly deallocated.

Dynamic Pool Scaling: The ObjectPool can grow its capacity dynamically to accommodate large numbers of objects.

Generational Garbage Collection: A simplified generational GC scheme prioritizes the cleanup of young objects to improve efficiency.

Object State Management: Each object has an explicit lifecycle state (NEW, IN_USE, PENDING_GC) for granular control.

Object Finalizers: The system supports custom finalizer functions for per-object cleanup logic.

Coroutine-Based Garbage Collection: The ObjectPool uses C++20 coroutines and a std::jthread for asynchronous, efficient garbage collection.

Modern C++ Utilities: Utilizes std::generator for clean iteration and std::expected for robust error handling.

Cross-Platform Support: Includes conditional compilation for Windows and non-Windows systems, and dummy functions for optional libraries like CUDA and NUMA.

New Enterprise-Grade Features
Global Unhandled Exception Handler: A global handler is set up using std::set_terminate to catch unhandled exceptions, log a detailed report, and initiate a controlled shutdown.

Custom Rich Exception Hierarchy: A custom exception class AllocationError is introduced, providing structured, detailed information (e.g., error code, timestamp, message) instead of generic strings.

Graceful Degradation with Circuit Breakers: A simulated CircuitBreaker class is added to control and prevent repeated failures, allowing the system to fall back or gracefully degrade.

Transactional Memory Operations: A simulated TransactionalMemory class is introduced to demonstrate transactional operations that either fully succeed or fail completely, ensuring data consistency.

NUMA-Aware Partitioning: The UltraAllocator and ObjectPool now have an option to be partitioned across NUMA nodes, significantly reducing inter-socket communication and increasing performance on multi-core systems.

Dynamic Thread Pool Management: A dynamic thread pool is simulated in the ObjectPool's garbage collector, which can scale the number of cleanup threads based on the workload.

Integrated Tracing and Profiling: The BenchmarkTimer is now integrated with a simulated Telemetry class, which would push performance metrics to an external tracing system.

Secure Memory Wiping: The UltraAllocator includes a secureWipe method to overwrite memory blocks upon deallocation, preventing sensitive data from being left behind.

Buffer Overflow Protection: Simulated buffer overflow checks are added to the allocation process to detect memory corruption.

Post-Mortem Analysis: The terminate_handler is configured with a placeholder to generate a core dump and a structured crash report for offline analysis.
