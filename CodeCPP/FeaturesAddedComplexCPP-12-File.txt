Features of the Refactored C++ Source Code_________From File 10 and File 11____________
The following is a comprehensive list of features in the merged and refactored C++23 source code, combining the advanced functionalities from both provided files into a single, cohesive, and scalable solution.

Unified Hierarchical Design: The code maintains a clear separation between the low-level UltraAllocator for raw memory management and the high-level ObjectPool for managing object lifecycles.

Dynamic Logging and Auditing: A Logger class with configurable levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR) is included for detailed, level-based logging. It also contains a placeholder for sending critical error logs to a separate auditing service.

Policy-Based Design: The framework uses policy-based programming for customizable logging (SilentPolicy, VerbosePolicy) and locking strategies.

Configurable Locking Strategies: The code defines a Lockable concept and policy structs (MutexPolicy, SharedMutexPolicy, AtomicFlagPolicy) to allow developers to select the appropriate locking primitive for their specific concurrency needs.

Built-in Benchmarking: A BenchmarkTimer class is available to measure the performance of operations, which is crucial for performance tuning.

Advanced, Granular Locking: The ObjectPool uses fine-grained locking with a separate mutex for each object entry to minimize contention in multi-threaded environments.

Memory Allocation: The UltraAllocator features a hybrid allocation strategy, combining a fast slab allocator for small objects with a best-fit allocator for larger, variable-sized blocks.

Memory Defragmentation and Compaction: The compactAndDefragment() method can reorganize memory blocks to reclaim fragmented space and improve memory utilization.

Persistent Memory: The allocator can map a file to memory, allowing the memory pool to persist its state across program runs.

Memory Protection: Methods like protectReadOnly() and protectReadWrite() provide runtime control over memory permissions, enhancing security.

Memory Integrity Checks: A validateIntegrity() function is included to simulate checks for data corruption.

Leak Detection: The UltraAllocator automatically reports any un-deallocated memory at shutdown.

Dynamic Pool Scaling: The ObjectPool can dynamically increase its capacity when all available slots are in use, accommodating a very large number of objects without a fixed size limitation.

Generational Garbage Collection (Simplified): A simplified generational GC scheme is implemented, prioritizing the cleanup of young, short-lived objects to reduce overhead.

Object State Management: Each object in the pool has an explicit lifecycle state (NEW, IN_USE, PENDING_GC), providing granular control and debugging capabilities.

Object Finalizers: The system supports user-defined finalizer functions for custom cleanup logic before an object is destroyed.

Coroutine-Based Garbage Collection: The ObjectPool uses C++20 coroutines, managed by a std::jthread, for asynchronous object cleanup, which is more efficient than traditional thread-and-lock approaches.

std::generator: The used_objects() method returns a std::generator for clean, C++23-style iteration over active objects.

std::expected: The ObjectPool's allocate() method uses std::expected for robust error handling, returning either a valid pointer or a descriptive error message.

Smart Reference Wrapper (Ref): The Ref class is a smart pointer-like wrapper that uses atomic reference counting to manage object lifetimes in a thread-safe way.

Cross-Platform Support: The code includes platform-specific headers and fallbacks for Windows and non-Windows systems, as well as dummy functions for optional libraries like CUDA and NUMA.
