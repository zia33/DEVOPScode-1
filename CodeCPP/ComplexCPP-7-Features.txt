Based on the C++23 code snippets provided, I have refactored and merged them into two distinct and comprehensive solutions, as they represent two different paradigms of memory management: a high-level Object Pool System and a low-level Advanced Memory Allocator.

Below is a summary of the features for each solution, followed by the complete refactored source code.

Solution 1: Advanced C++23 Object Pool System
This solution combines the object pool, smart reference counting, and policy-based design from your provided files. The core has been upgraded to use C++23 coroutines for a more modern and efficient garbage collection mechanism, replacing the traditional thread and condition variable approach. It also incorporates std::generator for easy iteration over live objects and maintains full support for polymorphic memory resources (std::pmr).

Key Features:


Concurrency: Thread-safe object allocation and reference counting using std::mutex and std::atomic.


Asynchronous Cleanup: Uses a C++23 coroutine and std::jthread for deferred, non-blocking garbage collection.


Policy-Based Design: Customizable logging behavior with SilentPolicy or VerbosePolicy.


Smart Pointer Integration: A Ref<T> smart wrapper provides automatic, thread-safe lifetime management for pooled objects.


Memory Management: Integrates C++17 std::pmr for pool-aware memory allocation, allowing for custom memory resources.

Iteration: The ObjectPool class offers a std::generator to elegantly iterate over all currently active objects in a range-based for loop.


Robustness: Uses std::expected for safe error reporting during allocation.


Diagnostics: Tracks and reports the number of currently used objects in the pool.

Solution 2: UltraAllocator: An Advanced C++23 Memory Allocator
This comprehensive allocator is a consolidation of the concepts from your ComplexCPP-4, ComplexCPP-5, and ComplexCPP-6 files. It provides a wide range of low-level memory management capabilities, including support for specialized hardware, security features, and diagnostic tools.

Key Features:

Memory Tagging: Allocates memory with user-defined tags for easier tracking and debugging.

Leak Detection: A reportLeaks() function can be called to check for any memory that has not been deallocated.

Memory Compaction: The compactAndDefragment() method physically moves allocated blocks to eliminate fragmentation.

GPU Integration: Supports CUDA zero-copy by allocating pinned memory via cudaMallocHost for efficient GPU kernel integration.

Persistent Memory: Can map a memory pool to a file on disk for persistence across application runs.

Memory Protection: Uses mprotect to set read-only or read-write permissions on the memory pool, simulating secure enclave behavior.

NUMA-Awareness: Can target a specific NUMA node for optimized performance on multi-processor systems.

Dynamic Resizing: The resize() function allows the memory pool to grow at runtime if needed.

Cross-Process Sharing: Uses mmap to simulate shared memory access.

Concurrency: Thread-safe allocation and deallocation using std::mutex.

Merged and Refactored Source Code
Below is the consolidated and refactored code for both solutions.

Solution 1: Advanced C++23 Object Pool System

Features Included in the Combined C++23 Code
The refactored code combines the best and most advanced features from all the provided C++ files, creating a single, highly sophisticated memory and object management solution.

Core Functionality & Memory Management
Unified Allocator (UltraAllocator): A single class manages both low-level raw memory and high-level, type-safe object instances.

Thread Safety: All allocation and deallocation operations are protected by mutexes and atomic operations to ensure safe use in multi-threaded environments.

Memory Compaction & Defragmentation: The allocator can reorganize memory to consolidate fragmented free space.

Telemetry & Diagnostics: It provides live tracking of memory usage, including total pool size, used memory, and a list of active allocations with their tags.

Leak Detection: The system can report any allocated memory that was not properly deallocated before the program ends.

Memory Tagging: Allocations can be tagged with descriptive strings for easier debugging and tracking.

Polymorphic Memory Resource (PMR) Support: The system is aware of std::pmr::memory_resource, allowing objects to be constructed with custom memory allocation policies.

Advanced C++23 Features
Coroutines for Asynchronous Cleanup: The garbage collection process runs on a separate thread and uses C++20 coroutines, managed by an std::jthread, to perform asynchronous cleanup of deallocated objects. This is a more modern and efficient approach than traditional thread-and-condition-variable loops.

std::jthread: Uses std::jthread for automatic thread management, which simplifies the code by handling thread joining on destruction.

std::generator: An std::generator is used to provide an elegant, C++23-style way to iterate over active objects in the pool using a range-based for loop.

std::expected: The allocate function uses std::expected to provide robust error handling, returning either a valid object pointer or a descriptive error message.

Specialized Memory Features
CUDA Zero-Copy (Pinned Memory): The allocator can use CUDA's host-pinned memory, enabling high-performance, zero-copy data transfer between the CPU and GPU.

Memory Protection: It can set memory protection flags to make portions of the memory pool read-only.

Persistent Memory Mapping: The allocator can use mmap with a backing file to create a memory pool that persists across program runs.

NUMA Node Targeting: The allocator can be configured to target specific NUMA nodes, optimizing memory access for systems with non-uniform memory architectures.

Secure Enclave Simulation: It simulates memory isolation for sensitive data by temporarily setting a memory protection flag to PROT_NONE before restoring access.

Slab Allocation: A specialized slab allocator is used for small, fixed-size allocations, which is highly efficient and reduces internal fragmentation.

Object Pool System: A high-level, type-safe object pool is implemented within the allocator, featuring:

Atomic Reference Counting: Uses atomic operations for thread-safe object lifetime management.

Policy-Based Logging: Allows the user to choose between verbose or silent logging for object allocations and deallocations.
