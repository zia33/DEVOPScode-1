Here are the key features and advanced logic of the provided C++23 source code, "ComplexCPP-8.cpp".

Features and Advanced Logic
This comprehensive code base integrates multiple modern C++ techniques for a production-grade, high-performance, and robust memory and object management solution.

1. Advanced Memory Allocation Strategies
Unified Hierarchical Design: The code separates concerns into a low-level UltraAllocator for raw memory and a high-level ObjectPool for object management, improving modularity and scalability.

Hybrid Allocation: The UltraAllocator uses two primary strategies:

A fast slab allocator for small, fixed-size objects. This is highly efficient and reduces internal fragmentation for common object sizes.

A best-fit allocator for larger, variable-sized allocations.

Memory Defragmentation: The compactAndDefragment() method can reorganize memory blocks to consolidate fragmented free space, which is critical for long-running applications to prevent memory exhaustion.

Persistent Memory: The allocator can map a file to memory using mmap, allowing the memory pool to persist its state across different program executions.

2. Enhanced Security and Performance
Memory Protection: The protectReadOnly() and protectReadWrite() methods provide runtime control over memory permissions, which is a key security feature for protecting critical data from accidental or malicious modification.

NUMA-Awareness: The UltraAllocator can be configured to target a specific NUMA (Non-Uniform Memory Access) node, optimizing memory access by keeping data local to the processor that uses it.

Secure Enclave Simulation: It includes a simplified simulation of a secure enclave using mprotect, which can temporarily isolate memory regions.

GPU Integration: The UltraAllocator supports CUDA host-pinned memory (cudaMallocHost), enabling high-performance, zero-copy data transfers between the CPU and GPU. The runGpuKernel() method demonstrates how this memory can be used with CUDA kernels.

3. Modern Asynchronous and Thread-Safe Design
Coroutine-Based Garbage Collection: The ObjectPool uses C++20 coroutines, managed by a std::jthread, for asynchronous object cleanup. This modern approach is more efficient than traditional thread-and-condition-variable loops, as the coroutine only runs when there is work to be done.

std::jthread: All worker threads are implemented using std::jthread, which automatically handles thread joining on destruction. This prevents resource leaks and simplifies resource management.

Atomic Reference Counting: The ObjectPool and Ref smart wrapper use atomic operations to manage the lifetime of objects in a thread-safe manner without explicit locks.

4. Improved APIs and Diagnostics
std::expected: The allocate function in the ObjectPool uses std::expected to provide robust error handling. It returns either a pointer to the allocated object or a string describing the failure.

std::generator: The ObjectPool provides an elegant, C++23-style used_objects() method that returns an std::generator. This allows for clean, range-based for loops to iterate over all active objects.

Detailed Telemetry: The UltraAllocator includes a printTelemetry() function for a comprehensive overview of the memory pool's state, including used, freed, and total memory, as well as a list of active allocations with their tags.

Memory Leak Detection: At shutdown, the UltraAllocator automatically calls reportLeaks(), which identifies and reports any memory that was allocated but not deallocated, a critical feature for maintaining code quality in a production environment.
